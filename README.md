👋 Hi there, I'm Amrutha — a full-stack developer who loves turning ideas into clean, scalable products.

💻 I work mostly with JavaScript, Python, and cloud-native tools — building full-stack apps using React, Next.js, Node.js, Flask, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

⚡ I enjoy solving real-world problems with code — from data-driven platforms to AI-integrated workflows. Currently exploring AI agents and automation tools.

🧠 Past work includes:  
- Building production-ready dashboards & APIs  
- Integrating RAG + LLMs in real-time apps  
- Optimizing backend systems for scale and performance  

🚀 Open to collaboration and freelance work. Let’s build something impactful!
